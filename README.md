# Google Maps MarkerFactory

This is a zero dependencies library that uses a canvas element to generate valid [google.maps.Marker](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/3.exp/reference#Marker) Icons from graphic-fonts, such as [Font-Awesome](https://fontawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and  [Fontello](http://fontello.com/).

## Why? 

Because some libraries, like google maps API, expect its Markers to have an valid [google.maps.Icon](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/3.exp/reference#Icon) to be shown on the map:

```js
	var mymarker = new google.maps.Marker({
		position: myMap.getCenter(),
		map: myMap
	});

	mymarker.setIcon({
		url: '/img/some_image.png',
		size: new google.maps.Size(54 , 48 ),
		origin: new google.maps.Point(0, 0),
		anchor: new google.maps.Point(27 , 24 )
	});
```

(Actually, it would be enough to set) 

```js
    mymarker.setIcon('/img/some_image.png');

```

But still, you need an image. You'll need to **host every icon and color combination** thay might ever be.

With MarkerFactory, you generate those icons on the fly.

## Example

run 

```sh
npm install
jspm install
serve .
```

Open your browser at http://localhost:3000/ and you'll be presented with three graphical fonts variations, both in
their CSS render as well as their PNG rendering generated by IG_Markerfactory.

Feel free to play with `examples/example.js` to see what happens when you try different colors, icons and scales.




## Installation

Install it with jspm like so:

```js
jspm install npm:ig_markerfactory
```


Or, if for some reason NPM is down:

```js
jspm install github:huasofoundries/ig_markerfactory
```

If you don't use jspm, you can as well clone this repo and copy 
`dist/markerfactory.js` to your project. 



## Usage

This is a simple example using AMD loading. It assumes you're using a font that's already present in the DOM. 

```js
define(['huasofoundries/ig_markerfactory'], function(MarkerFactory) {
	var myIcon = MarkerFactory.autoIcon({
		label: 'f1b9',
		font: 'FontAwesome',
		color: '#CC0000',
		fontsize: 20
	});

	console.log(myIcon);

});

```

You will see that `myIcon` object is a valid [google.maps.Icon](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/3.exp/reference#Icon) object,
but of course you might want the image for other purposes so you can just use `myIcon.url` which is a [data URI](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/data_URIs)
